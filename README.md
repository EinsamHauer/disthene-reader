disthene-reader: cassandra backed metric storage *reader*
=========================================================

## Motivation
This is a "dual" project to [disthene](https://github.com/EinsamHauer/disthene). Though the data written by **disthene** can still be read and plotted by combination of **cyanite** & **graphite-api**, this schema introduces quite some overhead at least caused by serializing/deserializing to/from json. In cases when rendering a graph involves 10s of millions of data points this overhead is quite noticable.
Besides that **graphite-api** as well as original **graphite** rendering could really be a bit faster.
All in all, this project is about read and rendering performance exactly like **disthene** is about write performance.

## What's in
The following APIs are supported:
* /paths API for backward compatibility with **graphite-api** and **cyanite**
* /metrics
* /render mostly as per Graphite specification version 0.10.0

The functions are mostly per Graphite specification version 0.10.0 with several exceptions below.

The following functions have a different implementation:
* stdev (see https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/issues/986)
* holtWintersForecast
* holtWintersConfidenceBands
* holtWintersConfidenceArea
* holtWintersAberration

The following functions are not implemented:
* smartSummarize
* fallbackSeries
* removeBetweenPercentile
* useSeriesAbove
* removeEmptySeries
* map
* mapSeries
* reduce
* reduceSeries
* identity
* cumulative
* consolidateBy
* changed
* substr
* time
* sin
* randomWalk
* timeFunction
* sinFunction
* randomWalkFunction
* events




## Compiling 

This is a standard Java Maven project. 

```
mvn package
```

will most probably do the trick.

## Running
There are a couple of things you will need in runtime, just the same set as for **cyanite** and/or **disthene**

* Cassandra
* Elasticsearch
* Graphite-web (probably a modified version like https://github.com/cybem/graphite-web-iow)
* [graphite-cyanite](https://github.com/brutasse/graphite-cyanite)

## Configuration
There several configuration files involved
* /etc/disthene-reader/disthene-reader.yaml (location can be changed with -c command line option if needed)
* /etc/disthene-reader/disthene-reader-log4j.xml (location can be changed with -l command line option if needed) 

##### Main configuration in disthene.yaml
```
reader:
# bind address and port
  bind: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8080
# rollups - currently only "s" units supported  
  rollups:
    - 60s:5356800s
    - 900s:62208000s
store:
# C* contact points, port, keyspace and table
  cluster:
    - "cassandra-1"
    - "cassandra-2"
  port: 9042
  keyspace: 'metric'
  columnFamily: 'metric'
# maximum connections per host , timeouts in seconds, max requests per host - these are literally used in C* java driver settings
  maxConnections: 2048
  readTimeout: 10
  connectTimeout: 10
  maxRequests: 128
index:
# ES cluster name, contact points, native port, index name & type
  name: "disthene"
  cluster:
    - "es-1"
    - "es-2"
  port: 9300
  index: "disthene"
  type: "path"
# Maxim number paths allowed per one wildcard. This is just to prevent abuse
  maxPaths: 50000
stats:
# flush self metrics every 'interval' seconds
  interval: 60
# tenant to use for stats
  tenant: "graphite"
# (optional) hostname to use if not specified system's hostname will be used
  hostname: "disthene-reader"
# (optional) path prefix for stats metrics, default to ""
  pathPrefix: ""
# carbon server to send stats to
  carbonHost: "carbon.example.net"
# carbon port to send stats to
  carbonPort: 2003  
```

##### Logging configuration in disthene-reader-log4j.xml
Configuration is straight forward as per log4j
